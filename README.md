# CK-Badminton-Tournament
A Web Based Tournament System for Badminton

The Uploaded Code base on Twitter Bootstrap http://getbootstrap.com and will use D3 http://d3js.org for visualisation.

Until now it is still in progress and I have to handle at first the javascript parts befor i can start thinking about the visualisation.
The main idear was to handle a complete editable Tournament with webbased technologies as well as a nice export for printing Tournament Trees and Charts.

I hope to get some input for better coding.

thanks a lot for your interest

yours Christoph
